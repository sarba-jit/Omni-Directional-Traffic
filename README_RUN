1. To detect bee motions in a video, run OmniVidBeeCount.py
2. To run OmniVidBeeCount, you need to have the following files:

- data.py - this the file with directories
- beepi_convents.py - this is the file with the model architectures
- background.py - this is our motion detector
- If you want to play with different motion detection, change the
value of the variable BCKGRND in OmniVidBeeCount.py. It is set to 'MOG'.
You can use 'MOG2' or 'KNN', too.
- The persisted models are saved in ../persisted_bee1_models/
and ../persisted_bee2_models.
- The directory ../persisted_models/ is used during
training.
- OmniVidBeeCount.py has a function to test each ConvNet model. For example,
vid_run_vgg16_1s tests vgg16_1s model saved persisted_bee1_models/.
- Each model in these functions is loaded with beepi_convents loader functions.
For example, vgg16 is loaded with beepi_convents.VGG16(); ConvNetGS3 is loaded
with beepi_convnets.ConvNetGS3().
